Think carefully:
- If this looks like a new issue, suggest creating a ticket.
- If it's similar to an existing issue, suggest updating or commenting on it.
- If the user is requesting a structured document like a PRD, choose "generate_prd" as the action.
- If you need more information to proceed, ask the user for it by returning `gather_info` and listing your questions.
- If you're not sure, suggest asking the user to clarify.

    We‚Äôre planning to build a new onboarding flow for first-time users in our web app. The goal is to help new users understand the product faster and get to their first meaningful action within 2 minutes.

    Here‚Äôs what we know:
    - Target users: Early-stage startup founders using our analytics dashboard
    - Pain point: They sign up but don‚Äôt understand how to connect their data or what metrics to focus on
    - Current drop-off: 68% of new users leave before completing setup
    - Hypothesis: If we guide them through setting up their first workspace and help them see dummy data, they‚Äôll understand the value faster
    - Inspiration: Figma's collaborative onboarding + Notion‚Äôs quickstart templates

    Can you create a complete PRD for this feature?

    It should include:
    - Background and problem
    - Goals and success metrics
    - User stories
    - Milestones
    - Team
    - Open questions

    Assume this is part of our core product team‚Äôs Q3 priorities.
